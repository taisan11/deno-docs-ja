# Pricing and limitations

Please see [our pricing page](https://www.deno.com/deploy/pricing) for the
overview of the available features in all plans. If you have a use case that
exceeds any of these limits, [please reach out](mailto:deploy@deno.com).

No uptime guarantees are provided during the initial public beta for Deno
Deploy. Access to the service will be controlled by
[our fair use policy](https://www.deno.com/deploy/fair-use-policy). Any user we
deem to be in violation of this policy, runs the risk of having their account
terminated.

## Maximum size for deployments

When uploading assets to a deployment, the total size of all files within the
deployment (source files and static files) __should not exceed 1 gigabyte__.

## TLS proxying

On the Free plan, TLS termination is required for outgoing connections to port
443 (the port used for HTTPS). Using
[Deno.connect](https://deno.land/api?s=Deno.connect) to connect to these ports
is prohibited. If you need to establish a TLS connection to port 443, please use
[Deno.connectTls](https://deno.land/api?s=Deno.connectTls) instead. `fetch` is
not impacted by this restriction.

This restriction is in place because connecting to port 443 without terminating
TLS is frequently used in TLS-over-TLS proxies, which are prohibited on the Deno
Deploy Free plan as per our Fair Use Policy.

This restriction impacts Free tier customers only. Pro tier customers are able
to connect to port 443 with both `Deno.connect` and `Deno.connectTls`.
